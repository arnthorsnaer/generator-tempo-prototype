# What is a UI prototype?

A piece of code that enables you to design and envision the system and explore the problem space with your stakeholders.

For our purposes we want high fidelity prototype but with minimal overhead during the design process. We assume our prototype projects are prototype only, and will not be further developed into an actual system. Many components can be used from the prototype since most of it consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
